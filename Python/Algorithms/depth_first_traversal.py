    This file sets up a simple graph example using the analogy of towns.
    The function Depth_First_Traversal demonstrates the DFT algorithm for graph traversal
    When traversed starting from Town A the order of a depth first traversal shall be the following:
        Town_A  
        Town_B
        Town_E 
        Town_D 
        Town_C
