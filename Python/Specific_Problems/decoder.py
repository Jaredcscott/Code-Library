    This file provides a method for decoding a message found by arranging provided data into a pyramid, 
    then combining the final entry for each row of the pyramid into a sentence. If the message file's contents are: 
    3 love
    6 computers
    2 dogs
    4 cats
    1 i
    5 you
    This process will construct a pyramid with the numeric values in the following format: 
      1 
     2 3
    4 5 6
    By combining the last elements in each row, (1, 3 and 6) we get the final decoded message of i love computers
