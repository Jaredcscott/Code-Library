    This function will classify a start using the stars properties. 
    Properties needed to classify:
        Temperature: In degrees Kelvin
        Radius     : In Solar Radii (Multiples of the Sun's radius) 
        Luminosity : In multiples of the Sun's luminosity 
        Solar Mass : In multiples of the Sun's solar Mass  

      Will classify a star following categories based on the given properties
      O, B, A, F, G, K and M
